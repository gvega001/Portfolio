<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
    Hello! I’m <strong>Gabriel Vega</strong>, a dedicated <strong>software developer</strong>
    and technology enthusiast with over <strong>20 years of professional experience</strong>—much
    of it spent at the intersection of <strong>education</strong> and <strong>technology</strong>.
    While I’ve taught programming and math in classroom settings, my true passion lies in
    <strong>innovating</strong>, <strong>building</strong>, and <strong>delivering</strong>
    robust software solutions.
</p>

<h2>My Technical Toolkit</h2>
<ul>
    <li>

</ul>

<h2>Bridging Education &amp; Tech</h2>
<p>
    My background in <strong>teaching</strong> not only honed my communication and
    mentorship skills but also gave me a unique viewpoint for designing software—
    particularly solutions that improve user learning and engagement. Some highlights include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Developing and integrating <em>C-based</em> and <em>C#</em> applications for
        robotics programs
    </li>
    <li>
        Introducing <em>Docker</em> for streamlined deployments and environment consistency
    </li>
    <li>
        Mentoring teams on <em>agile methodologies</em>, test-driven development,
        and continuous integration
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Why I’m Excited About Tech</h2>
<p>
    Having led interdisciplinary STEM/robotics classes, I’ve witnessed firsthand how
    <strong>hands-on tech</strong> can empower people and organizations. I’m now focusing on
    <strong>full-time software development</strong>, eager to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Build scalable <em>.NET</em> or <em>Java</em> applications</li>
    <li>Explore <em>AI</em> and data-driven projects</li>
    <li>Contribute to platforms that reshape how people interact with technology</li>
</ul>

<h2>Beyond the Code</h2>
<p>
    When I’m not coding or prototyping, you might find me:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Experimenting with new <em>IoT</em> or robotics projects</li>
    <li>Reading up on the latest <em>DevOps</em> practices</li>
    <li>
        Sharing my knowledge with others—both students and fellow developers
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>
    <strong>In a nutshell</strong>: I’m an adaptable developer who merges a strong
    <em>technical foundation</em> with a proven ability to <em>communicate</em>,
    <em>mentor</em>, and <em>drive projects</em> forward. With a passion for
    <em>innovation</em> and <em>collaboration</em>, I’m looking to bring my expertise
    in <strong>software development</strong>, <strong>cloud technologies</strong>, and
    <strong>educational insight</strong> to organizations shaping tomorrow’s tech landscape.

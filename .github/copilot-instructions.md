1. Global Context & Full Solution Access
Solution Name: Portfolio
Projects:
Portfolio – Main .NET MAUI project (likely containing MauiProgram.cs).
Portfolio.Shared – Shared library for common models, services, and business logic.
Portfolio.Web – ASP.NET Core server or Blazor Server host (optional).
Portfolio.Web.Client – Blazor WebAssembly client or Razor Class Library.
Important:
Copilot, assume you have read and write access to all files within these four projects. Always consider the entire solution—including cross-project references—when generating or refactoring code. If you modify an interface in Portfolio.Shared, ensure any implementations in Portfolio, Portfolio.Web, or Portfolio.Web.Client are also updated accordingly.

2. Project Overview & Goals
Portfolio Focus
A modern, minimalist portfolio that showcases your projects, skills, and integrates interactive AI features (OpenAI/GPT-driven chatbot). It targets a consistent, high-performance experience across native (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android) and web platforms.

Technology Stack
.NET 9 MAUI Blazor Hybrid: Combines native UI with Blazor web components.
Blazor Components & Pages: Used for dynamic content (Home, About, Portfolio, Contact).
AI Integration: Incorporate OpenAI (or GPT4All) for interactive chatbot and code explanations.
Styling: Use TailwindCSS (or MudBlazor) for responsive, modern UI.
Coding Standards: Embrace C# 12 features, async/await patterns, dependency injection, and SOLID principles.
Project Vision & Features
Modern UI/UX: Minimalist design, subtle animations, and responsive layouts.
Projects Showcase: Interactive cards, filters, modals for detailed descriptions.
AI Integration: GPT-based chatbot, resume enhancer, project walkthrough AI.
Optional Extensions: Blog section, dark/light mode toggle, multilingual support, analytics.
3. Project Roles & Responsibilities
Portfolio (MAUI Blazor Hybrid)

The cross-platform entry point.
Uses BlazorWebView to render Razor components for a native-like experience.
References shared logic from Portfolio.Shared.
May handle AI service calls via dependency injection if done client-side.
Portfolio.Shared

Central location for shared code: models, DTOs, interfaces, and core business logic.
Minimizes duplication, enabling reuse across MAUI, web, and any other consumers.
Portfolio.Web

An optional ASP.NET Core host for Blazor pages, server-side logic, or APIs.
Could host the Blazor WASM client, handle backend tasks, or store form submissions.
Ideal for integrating server-side AI calls or database interactions.
Portfolio.Web.Client

A Blazor WebAssembly project or Razor Class Library.
Provides a purely web-based version of your portfolio if deployed to static hosts.
Reuses logic from Portfolio.Shared to keep features consistent across platforms.
4. Project Structure Recap
Within each project, you may see folders like:

/Pages
Blazor pages (e.g., Home, About, Portfolio, Contact).

Copilot Tip: Ensure each page has proper routing and lifecycle methods.

/Components
Reusable UI components like NavMenu, Footer, and ProjectCards.

Copilot Tip: Factor out common UI elements to promote reusability and maintainability.

/Platforms (MAUI-specific)
Platform-specific configurations for Android, iOS, Windows, etc.

Copilot Tip: Verify platform settings for resources, icons, and platform-specific behaviors.

/wwwroot
Static assets (CSS, JS, images).

Copilot Tip: Optimize asset loading and consider lazy-loading larger resources.

/Services
Business logic, API services (e.g., GPT integration).

Copilot Tip: Implement interfaces for services and register them with dependency injection for testability and modularity.

5. Key Development Areas & Copilot Guidance
A. Blazor & Component Enhancements
Reusable Component Patterns

Implement patterns for modals, cards, and nav menus using Blazor’s RenderFragment.
Example:
razor
Copy
@* NavMenu.razor *@
<nav class="bg-gray-800 p-4">
  <ul class="flex space-x-4">
    @foreach(var link in NavigationLinks)
    {
        <li>
          <NavLink class="text-white" href="@link.Url">@link.Title</NavLink>
        </li>
    }
  </ul>
</nav>
Copilot Tip: Prioritize clean separation of concerns and reusability.
Component Libraries

If using TailwindCSS, ensure you configure it properly in your web projects or within the MAUI pipeline.
If using MudBlazor, reference the library in both the MAUI project (via BlazorWebView) and the web project for consistency.
B. AI Integration with OpenAI/GPT4All
Service Layer (in /Services)
Create an interface (e.g., IOpenAiService) with asynchronous methods to call OpenAI’s API.
Example:
csharp
Copy
public interface IOpenAiService
{
    Task<string> GetChatbotResponseAsync(string prompt);
}

public class OpenAiService : IOpenAiService
{
    private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;
    public OpenAiService(HttpClient httpClient)
    {
        _httpClient = httpClient;
    }

    public async Task<string> GetChatbotResponseAsync(string prompt)
    {
        var response = await _httpClient.PostAsync("https://api.openai.com/v1/...", new StringContent(prompt));
        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
        return await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    }
}
Copilot Tip: Use async/await for non-blocking API calls and handle exceptions gracefully.
Secure API keys using .NET secret management or environment variables.
C. Dependency Injection & C# 12 Enhancements
Program.cs or MauiProgram.cs Setup
Register services using DI for easy testing and separation of concerns.
Example:
csharp
Copy
var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();
builder
  .UseMauiApp<App>()
  .ConfigureFonts(fonts =>
  {
      fonts.AddFont("OpenSans-Regular.ttf", "OpenSansRegular");
  });

// Register AI service
builder.Services.AddHttpClient<IOpenAiService, OpenAiService>();

var app = builder.Build();
return app;
Copilot Tip: Leverage C# 12 features (list patterns, global using directives, etc.) for cleaner code.
D. UI/UX & Performance Optimizations
Responsive Layouts

Use TailwindCSS or MudBlazor to ensure fluid designs across mobile and desktop.
Copilot Tip: Generate components with accessibility standards (ARIA attributes, semantic HTML).
Performance

Optimize Blazor component rendering with correct lifecycle methods.
Implement lazy loading for images or heavy components.
Copilot Tip: Suggest improvements in data fetching and caching where possible.
6. Copilot Guidance & Best Practices
Full Solution Awareness

Reference any file across Portfolio, Portfolio.Shared, Portfolio.Web, and Portfolio.Web.Client.
If you refactor an interface in Portfolio.Shared, update implementations in other projects.
Dependency Injection & Services

Define interfaces (e.g., IProjectService, IOpenAiService) in Portfolio.Shared.
Implement them in Portfolio (MAUI) or Portfolio.Web (server) as needed.
Register them in MauiProgram.cs or Program.cs.
MAUI Blazor Hybrid

Use BlazorWebView to render Razor components from the same project or a referenced RCL (Portfolio.Web.Client).
Maintain a single set of UI components for both native/hybrid and web experiences.
Secure AI Integrations

Keep your OpenAI or GPT keys secure (e.g., environment variables, .NET Secret Manager).
Use async/await and robust error handling for all API calls.
UI & Styling

Ensure consistent theming (TailwindCSS, MudBlazor, or custom CSS).
Provide light/dark modes for user preference and accessibility.
Performance & Accessibility

Optimize images, enable lazy loading, and use semantic HTML.
Follow WCAG guidelines for color contrast, ARIA labels, and screen reader support.
7. Deployment Strategy
A. Pre-Deployment Checklist
Platform Validation

Double-check configurations in /Platforms for Android, iOS, Windows, etc.
Validate AI/API keys and secure them using .NET secret management.
Testing
